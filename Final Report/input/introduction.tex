\section{Introduction}

In the context of the Distributed System Engineering project task, we designed a web-based application using the tools provided by the Google Maps API, that allows a tourist to personalize and optimize is route while visiting a city. The user may enter in the page the places he wants to visit, and the application will provide a optimized path to the several places the user set, with traveling indications. In this report, we will first present our application, its features and how it is used. Then, we will detail the technologies we used to create our application, with some illustrations. Finally, in the second part of our report, we will conclude on the performance testing of the application.
