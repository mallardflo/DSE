\section{Introduction}

We want to design an application which allows a tourist to optimize his visit of a city, offering him to select the monuments he wants to see and finding the best way to go to all of them. At first we also thought of a few additional features, such as displaying the distance between each monument in the list and the traveling time. In order to know what existing tourism applications already offer to do, and decide whether it's worth adding features to our application or not, we found some and analyzed them. In the following report we will firstly propose a description of the applications we found, their features, why we decided to implement them or not, and the technologies involved.
Then we will also show the results of our analyze of Google Maps API, which we will use in our application. It will include what we can do with it, the ease of implementation and the services proposed by the API.
